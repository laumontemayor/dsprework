## Python Tutorial

To get familiar with Python, please follow
[Dive into Python](http://www.diveintopython.net/toc/index.html),
Chapters 2 through 6. You can download the PDF version, or
[follow it online](http://www.diveintopython.net/toc/index.html).

Of course, depending on your experience with Python, you can skip
parts or the entire tutorial. However, if you are not already very
familiar with using python, we believe that this tutorial will be very
useful.


##### Note on the interpreter
If you never used the Python interpreter before,
[this page](http://www.diveintopython.net/installing_python/shell.html)
explains how it works. You run the interpreter by just entering

     python

on the command line.

When running the programs in the tutorial, try writing/editing them in
Emacs, and run them from the command line:

     python my_test_program.py

How long the tutorial will take depends on how familiar you are with
Python.
